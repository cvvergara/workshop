pgRouting Algorithms
===============================================================================

pgRouting was first called *pgDijkstra*, because it implemented only shortest
path search with *Dijkstra* algorithm. Later other functions were added and the
library was renamed to pgRouting.

pgr_dijkstra
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Dijkstra algorithm was the first algorithm implemented in pgRouting. It doesn't
require other attributes than ``id``, ``source`` and ``target`` ID and ``cost``.
You can specify when to consider the graph as `directed
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_graph>`__ or undirected.

.. rubric:: Signature Summary

.. code-block:: sql

  pgr_dijkstra(edges_sql, start_vid,  end_vid)
  pgr_dijkstra(edges_sql, start_vid,  end_vid  [, directed])
  pgr_dijkstra(edges_sql, start_vid,  end_vids [, directed])
  pgr_dijkstra(edges_sql, start_vids, end_vid  [, directed])
  pgr_dijkstra(edges_sql, start_vids, end_vids [, directed])

  RETURNS SET OF (seq, path_seq [, start_vid] [, end_vid], node, edge, cost, agg_cost)
      OR EMPTY SET

Description of the parameters can be found in `pgr_dijkstra
<http://docs.pgrouting.org/latest/en/pgr_dijkstra.html#description-of-the-signatures>`__.

.. note::
  * Many pgRouting functions have ``sql::text`` as one of their arguments. While
    this may look confusing at first, it makes the functions very flexible as
    the user can pass any ``SELECT`` statement as function argument as long as
    the returned result contains the required number of attributes and the
    correct attribute names.
  * Most of pgRouting implemeted algorithms do not require the network geometry.
  * Most of pgRouting functions **do not** return a geometry, but only an ordered
    list of nodes or edges.

.. rubric:: Identifiers for the Queries

The assignment of the vertices identifiers on the source and target columns may
be different, the following exercises will use the results of this query.
For the workshop, some locations near of the FOSS4G Dar Es Salaam event are going to be used.
These locations are within this area http://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=16/-6.8139/39.2976

Exercise 1 - Single pedestrian routing.
...............................................................................

.. rubric:: Walking from the Serena hotel to the Venue

.. image:: /images/pedestrian-route1.png
  :width: 300pt
  :alt: From the Serena Hotel, going to the Venue


* The pedestrian wants to go from vertex ``1639`` to vertex ``1195``.
* The pedestrian's cost is in terms of length. In this case ``length``, which
  was calculated by osm2pgrouting, is in unit ``degrees``.
* From a pedestrian perspective the graph is ``undirected``, that is, the
  pedestrian can move in both directions on all segments.

:ref:`Solution to Exercise 1`

.. note::
  * The returned cost attribute represents the cost specified in the
    inner SQL query (``edges_sql::text`` argument). In this example cost is ``length`` in unit
    "degrees". Cost may be time, distance or any combination of both or any
    other attributes or a custom formula.
  * ``node`` and ``edge`` results may vary depending on the assignment of the
    identifiers to the vertices given by osm2pgrouting.

* The cost to be in minutes, with a walking speed ``s = 1.3 m/s`` and ``t = d/s``

.. note::
  Inspecting the results, looking for totals (`edge = -1`):

  * Going to vertex 856:

    - from 1195 takes 7.58936281639964 minutes (row 4)
    - from 1639 takes 14.1217680758304  minutes (row 23)

  * Going to to vertex 1256:

    - from 1195 takes 20.5968484435532 minutes (row 16)
    - from 1639 takes 26.7767911805329  minutes (row 39)


pgr_dijkstraCost
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When the main goal is to calculate the total cost, without "inspecting" the `pgr_dijkstra` results,
using ``pgr_dijkstraCost`` returns a more compact result.

  pgr_dijkstraCost(edges_sql, start_vids, end_vid  [, directed])
  pgr_dijkstraCost(edges_sql, start_vids, end_vids [, directed])

  RETURNS SET OF (start_vid, end_vid, agg_cost)
      OR EMPTY SET

* The pedestrians want to go to destinations ``856``, ``1256``.
* The cost to be in minutes, with a walking speed ``s = 1.3 m/s`` and ``t = d/s``
* Result as aggregated costs.

Exercise 6 - Many Pedestrians going to different destinations sumirizes the total costs per destination.
...........................................................................................................

.. rubric:: Walking from the hotel or venue to the Botanical garden or the museum (sumirize cost in minutes).

* The pedestrians depart from ``1639``, ``1195``.
* The pedestrians want to go to destinations ``856``, ``1256``.
* The cost to be in minutes, with a walking speed s = 1.3 m/s and t = d/s
* Result adds the costs per destination.

.. literalinclude:: solutions/shortest_problems.sql
  :language: sql
  :start-after: d-6.txt


:ref:`Solution to Exercise 6`

.. note:: An interpretation of the result can be: In general, it is slightly faster to depart from the Venue.
