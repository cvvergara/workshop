Routing, is not limited to pedestrians and most of the time is used for routing vehicles.

Routing for Vehicles
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A query for vehicle routing generally differs from routing for pedestrians:

* the road segments are considered `directed`,
* Costs can be:

  * Distance
  * Time
  * Euros
  * Pesos
  * Dollars
  * CO2 emittions
  * Ware and tear on the vehicle, etc.

* The `reverse_cost` attribute must be taken into account on two way streets.

  * The costs should have the same units as the `cost` attribute
  * `cost` and `reverse_cost` can be different

This is due to the fact that there are roads that
are "one way".

Depending on the geometry, the valid way:

* (source, target) segment (``cost >= 0`` and ``reverse_cost < 0``)
* (target, source) segment (``cost < 0`` and ``reverse_cost >= 0``)

So a "wrong way" is indicated with a **negative value** and is not inserted in the
graph for processing.

For two way roads ``cost >= 0`` and ``reverse_cost >= 0`` and their values can
be different. For example, it is faster going down hill on a sloped road.
In general ``cost`` and ``reverse_cost`` do not need to be length; they can be
almost anything, for example time, slope, surface, road type, etc., or they can
be a combination of multiple parameters.

.. rubric:: The following queries indicate the number of road segments, where a "one way" rule applies:

#. Number of (source, target) segments with ``cost < 0``

* The vehicle is going from vertex ``1639`` to vertex ``1256``.
* Use ``cost`` and ``reverse_cost`` columns, which are in unit ``degrees``.

.. note:: On a directed graph, going and coming back routes, most of the time are different.

* The vehicle is going from vertex ``1256`` to vertex ``1639``.
* The cost is ``$100 per hour``.
* Use ``cost_s`` and ``reverse_cost_s`` columns, which are in unit ``seconds``.
* The duration in hours is ``cost / 3600``
* The cost in ``$`` is ``cost / 3600 * 100``

.. note::
  Comparing with :ref:`Exercise 8<exercise-8>`:

  * The total number of records are identical
  * The node sequence is identical
  * The edge sequence is identical
  * The cost and agg_cost results are directly proportional

When dealing with data, being aware of what kind of data is being used, can improve results.

* Vehciles can not circulate pedestrian ways,
* Likewise, routing not using pedestrian ways

Will make the results closer to reality.

When converting data from OSM format using the osm2pgrouting tool, there is an
additional tables: ``configuration``

In the image above there is a detail of the ``tag_id`` of the roads.

.. rubric:: osm way types

.. literalinclude:: solutions/advanced_problems.sql
  :language: sql
  :start-after: info-1.txt
  :end-before: info-2.txt

.. literalinclude:: solutions/info-1.txt

Also on the ``ways`` table there is a column that can be used to `JOIN` with the ``configuration`` table.

.. rubric:: The ``ways`` types

.. literalinclude:: solutions/advanced_problems.sql
  :language: sql
  :start-after: info-2.txt
  :end-before: ad-10.txt

In this workshop, costs are going to be manipulated using the ``configuration`` table.

* The vehicle is going from vertex ``856`` to vertex ``1461``.
* The vehicle's cost in this case will be in seconds.
* All roads have a ``penalty`` of `1`
* Costs are to be multiplied by :code:`penalty`
* Costs wont change (times 1 leaves the value unchanged).
* The :code:`configuration` table is linked with the :code:`ways` table by the
  :code:`tag_id` field using a ``JOIN``.

.. _exercise-11:

Exercise 11 - Vehicle routing with penalization
...............................................................................

Change the cost values for the :code:`configuration` table, in such a way, that the
* pedestrian roads are not used
* Using residential roads its not encouraged.
* Using "faster" roads is highly encouraged.
* The ``penalty`` values can be changed ``UPDATE`` queries.

.. note:: This values are an exageration

.. note::
  Comparing with :ref:`Exercise 9<exercise-9>`:

  * The total number of records changed.
  * The node sequence changed.
  * The edge sequence changed.
  * The route is avoiding the residential roads that have ``tag_id = 110``
