pgRouting functions provide `low level` interface.
When developing for a `higher level` application,
the requirements need to be represented in the SQL queries.
As these SQL queries get more complex, it is desirable to store them in postgreSQL stored procedures.
Stored procedures are an effective way to wrap application logic, in this case, related to routing logic.



.. contents:: Chapter Contents

The application requirements
===============================================================================

The stored procedure that is going to be developed has the following requirements:

#. Vehicles are routed.
    - Do not use pedestrian roads.
    - Once the `VIEW` is created, it is going to be used on the other requirements.
    - Costs are to be in minutes.

      - :ref:`exercise-d-4` solves a pedestrian routing in minutes.

#. Starting and ending vertices are by selection using `osm_id`.
    - In past chapters was done using the `id` of the vertices.

#. Name of the road on the path.
#. The geometry segments along the route path with the corrent orientation.
    - Geometry is to be returned.
    - Azimuth in degrees of the geometry is to be returned
    - Geometry handling to get the correct orientation.

Exercise 1 - Segments for Vehicle Routing
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

.. image:: /images/chapter7/ch7-e1.png
  :width: 300pt
  :alt: View of roads for vehicles

.. rubric:: The vehicle can not circulate on non pedestrian roads

* Create a view of the allowed road network for circulation.
* Routing `costs` will be based on minutes.
* Verify the reduced number of road segments

  :width: 300pt
  :alt: View of smaller set of roads for vehicles

.. rubric:: The vehicle can only circulate inside this Boundig Box:
   ``(-71.05 42.34, -71.03 42.35)``

* The vehicle can only circulate inside the bounding box:
   ``(-71.05 42.34, -71.03 42.35)``
* Create a view of the allowed road network for circulation.
* Use the ``vehicle_net`` `VIEW`.
* Verify the reduced number of road segments

  :alt:   From the Venue to the hotel using the osm_id.

.. rubric:: From the Venue to the hotel using the osm_id.


* The vehicle is going from the Venue at ``252643343``
* The vehicle is going to the hotel at ``302057309``.
* Start and end vertex are given with their ``osm_id``.
* The result should contain:

  * ``seq`` for ordering and unique row identifier

  :width: 300pt
  :alt:  Route showing names

.. rubric:: From the Venue to the Brewry, additionally get the name of the roads.

* The vehicle is going from the Venue at ``252643343``
* The vehicle is going to the hotel at ``302057309``.
* The result should contain:

  * ``seq`` for ordering and unique row identifier
  * the ``name`` of the road segments

Geometry handling
===============================================================================

.. _exercise-ch7-e5:

Exercise 5 - Route geometry (human readable)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

.. rubric:: From the Venue to the hotel, additionally get the geometry in human readable form.

.. image:: /images/chapter7/ch7-e5.png
  :width: 300pt
  :alt: From the Venue to the Brewry

* The vehicle is going from the Venue at ``252643343``
* The vehicle is going to the hotel at ``302057309``.
* The result should contain:

  * ``seq`` for ordering and unique row identifier
  * the ``name`` of the road segments
  * the geometry of the path in human readable form.

.. literalinclude:: solutions/wrapper_problems.sql
  :language: sql
  :linenos:
  :start-after: ch7-e5.txt
  :end-before: ch7-e6.txt

:ref:`Solution to Chapter 7 Exercise 5`

.. note::
  The last record of the result, does not contain a geometry value since the
  shortest path function returns ``-1`` for the last record to indicate the end
  of the route.




.. _exercise-ch7-e6:

Exercise 6 - Route geometry (binary format)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

.. image:: /images/chapter7/ch7-e6.png
  :width: 300pt
  :alt: From Venue to hotel showing arrows.

.. rubric:: From the Venue to the hotel by car, get the binary format geometry
    that can be used by a front end app.

.. note:: Not using ``ST_AsText`` gives the binary format.

.. tip::
  ``WITH`` provides a way to write auxiliary statements in larger queries.
  It can be thought of as defining temporary tables that exist just for one query.

* The vehicle is going from the Venue at ``252643343``
* The vehicle is going to the hotel at ``302057309``.
* The result should contain:

  * ``seq`` for ordering and unique row identifier
  * the ``name`` of the road segments
  * the geometry of the path in human readable form.
  * the geometry of the path in default binary format.

.. literalinclude:: solutions/wrapper_problems.sql

.. _exercise-ch7-e7:

Exercise 7 - Using the geometry
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

.. image:: /images/chapter7/ch7-e7.png
  :width: 300pt
  :alt: From Venue to hotel show azimuth

.. rubric:: From the Venue to the hotel, calculate the azimuth in degrees.

* The vehicle is going from the Venue at ``252643343``
* The vehicle is going to the hotel at ``302057309``.
* Get the ``seq``, ``name``, ``cost``, ``azimuth`` in degrees and the ``geomtery``
* The geometry of the route path in human readable form & binary form


.. literalinclude:: solutions/wrapper_problems.sql
  :language: sql
  :linenos:
  :start-after: ch7-e7.txt
  :end-before: ch7-e8.txt

:ref:`Solution to Chapter 7 Exercise 7`






.. _exercise-ch7-e8:

Exercise 8 - Geometry directionality
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

.. image:: /images/chapter7/ch7-e8.png
  :width: 300pt
  :alt: From Venue to hotel showing arrows.

.. rubric:: From the Venue, going to the hotel by car, get the geometry with
    correct arrow directionality.

When we generate a route the segements are returned as the geometry in the database.
that means the segments can be reverserd relative to the direction of the `route path`.
Goal is to have all segments oriented correctly along the route path.


* The vehicle is going from the Venue at ``252643343``
* The vehicle is going to the hotel at ``302057309``.
* The first point of the segment must "match" with the last point of the
  previous segment.
* Get the ``seq``, ``name``, ``cost``, ``azimuth`` and the ``geomtery``
* The geometry of the route path in human readable form & binary form

.. note::
  Comparing row 1 & 2 from :ref:`Solution to Chapter 7 Exercise 5`

  ::

    -- from Exercise 5
    LINESTRING(39.2902655 -6.8114116, ... ,39.2910718 -6.8102817)
    LINESTRING(39.2888771 -6.8127504, ... ,39.2902655 -6.8114116)

    -- from Excercise 8
    LINESTRING(39.2910718 -6.8102817, ... ,39.2902655 -6.8114116)
    LINESTRING(39.2902655 -6.8114116, ... ,39.2888771 -6.8127504)

  * In Exercise 5 the first point of the second segment **does not match** the
    last point of the first segment
  * In Exercise 7 the first point of the second segment **matches** the last
    point of the first segment




Creating a Function
===============================================================================

The following function simplifies (and sets default values) when it calls the
shortest path Dijkstra function.

.. tip::
  pgRouting uses heavely function overloading:

  * Avoid the name of a function installed with pgRouting
  * Avoid the name of a function starting with `pgr_` & `ST_`

.. _exercise-ch7-e9:

Exercise 9 - Function for an application
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


.. rubric:: Putting all together in a SQL function

* Should work for any given area.
* Data tables:

  * the edges are found in **ways**
  * the vertices are found in **ways_vertices_pgr**

* Allow a view as a parameter

  * A table can be used if the columns have the correct names

* Start and end vertex are given with their ``osm_id``.
* The result should contain:

  * ``seq``, ``name``, ``cost``, ``azimuth`` and the ``geomtery``
  * The geometry of the route path in human readable form & binary form


.. literalinclude:: solutions/wrapper_problems.sql
  :linenos:
  :start-after: ch7-e9.txt
  :end-before: ch7-e10.txt

:ref:`Solution to Chapter 7 Exercise 9`

.. _exercise-ch7-e10:

Exercise 10 - Using the function
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* The ``osm_id`` must exist on the ``ways_vertices_pgr`` table.
* If an ``osm_id`` falls outside the view, No path will be returned.

.. literalinclude:: solutions/wrapper_problems.sql
  :language: sql
  :linenos:
  :start-after: ch7-e10.txt
  :end-before: tmp.txt

:ref:`Solution to Chapter 7 Exercise 10`

.. note:: Try the function with ``little_net`` and a combination of the interesting places:

  * `252643343` The intersection near the entrance to the venue
  * `252963461` National Museum and House of Culture
  * `302056515` Fish market and the beach
  * `302057309` Serena Hotel
  * `1645787956` Botanical garden

Exercise 11 - Saving the function
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

.. rubric:: Save the function code above into a file ``~/Desktop/workshop/dijkstraHeading.sql``.

Saving functions in a file can be used to install the functionin another database.
Install the function into the database with:

.. code-block:: bash

    psql -U user -d city_routing -f ~/Desktop/workshop/wrk_dijkstra.sql
